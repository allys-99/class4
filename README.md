2  CI Continuous Integration is a process used during software development to reduce costs.
      Deliverables are evaluated regularly, could be a few times a day.  As software is built
      it is in the best interest to find issues sooner rather than later.  This is useful for 
      unit test or feature test.  It can also be used during integrations.  Software can be
      built, installed and tested overnight.
      Semaphore is a continuous integration platform.  When someone pushes new code to
      GitHub, it will immediately run all tests on that branch.  And every time a new 
      branch is created, Semaphore builds it automatically.  It also cleans up.
